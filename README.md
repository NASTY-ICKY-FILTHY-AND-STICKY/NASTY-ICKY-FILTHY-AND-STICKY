 Hey. I'm Brutus. I dunno where ya saw me, but it's probably from that fuckass pony game. I'm a digital artist, and I don't really do anything on GitHub. Now, you wanna see some action? Check out my Toyhou.se, Furaffinity, or better yet, my Twitter! But, be warned, my twitter is mostly me reposting gay stuff.

 I'm a minor so don't be weird.

I should clarify I don't care who or what you listen to. Even if the artist is problematic, if you don't defend or support them directly, I don't care.
